You might google around a bit and find discussion of something called \u201crelativistic mass,\u201d and how it requires more force to accelerate an object that\u2019s already moving at a high velocity, stuff like that. That\u2019s a venerable way of interpreting the mathematics of special relativity, but I find it unnecessarily misleading, and confusing to the student who\u2019s just dipping her first toe into the ocean of modern physics. It makes the universe sound like a much different, and much less wonderful, place than it really is, and for that I kind of resent it.\n\n&gt;When I talk about this subject, I do it in terms of the geometric interpretation that\u2019s consistent with general relativity. It\u2019s less straightforward, but it doesn\u2019t involve anything fundamentally more difficult than arrows on pieces of paper, and I think it offers a much better understanding of the universe we live in than hiding behind abstractions like \u201cforce\u201d and outright falsehoods like \u201crelativistic mass.\u201d Maybe it\u2019ll work for you, maybe it won\u2019t, but here it is in any case.\n\n&gt;First, let\u2019s talk about directions, just to get ourselves oriented. \u201cDownward\u201d is a direction. It\u2019s defined as the direction in which things fall when you drop them. \u201cUpward\u201d is also a direction; it\u2019s the opposite of downward. If you have a compass handy, we can define additional directions: northward, southward, eastward and westward. These directions are all defined in terms of something \u2014 something that we in the business would call an \u201corthonormal basis\u201d \u2014 but let\u2019s forget that right now. Let\u2019s pretend these six directions are absolute, because for what we\u2019re about to do, they might as well be.\n\n&gt;I\u2019m going to ask you now to imagine two more directions: futureward and pastward. You can\u2019t point in those directions, obviously, but it shouldn\u2019t be too hard for you to understand them intuitively. Futureward is the direction in which tomorrow lies; pastward is the direction in which yesterday lies.\n\n&gt;These eight directions together \u2014 upward, downward, northward, southward, eastward, westward, pastward, futureward \u2014 describe the fundamental geometry of the universe. Each pair of directions we can call a \u201cdimension,\u201d so the universe we live in is four-dimensional. Another term for this four-dimensional way of thinking about the universe is \u201cspacetime.\u201d I\u2019ll try to avoid using that word whenever necessary, but if I slip up, just remember that in this context \u201cspacetime\u201d basically means \u201cthe universe.\u201d\n\n&gt;So that\u2019s the stage. Now let\u2019s consider the players.\n\n&gt;You, sitting there right now, are in motion. It doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re moving. It feels like you\u2019re at rest. But that\u2019s only because everything around you is also in motion. No, I\u2019m not talking about the fact that the Earth is spinning or that our sun is moving through the galaxy and dragging us along with it. Those things are true, but we\u2019re ignoring that kind of stuff right now. The motion I\u2019m referring to is motion in the futureward direction.\n\n&gt;Imagine you\u2019re in a train car, and the shades are pulled over the windows. You can\u2019t see outside, and let\u2019s further imagine (just for sake of argument) that the rails are so flawless and the wheels so perfect that you can\u2019t feel it at all when the train is in motion. So just sitting there, you can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re moving or not. If you looked out the window you could tell \u2014 you\u2019d either see the landscape sitting still, or rolling past you. But with the shades drawn over the windows, that\u2019s not an option, so you really just can\u2019t tell whether or not you\u2019re in motion.\n\n&gt;But there is one way to know, conclusively, whether you\u2019re moving. That\u2019s just to sit there patiently and wait. If the train\u2019s sitting at the station, nothing will happen. But if it\u2019s moving, then sooner or later you\u2019re going to arrive at the next station.\n\n&gt;In this metaphor, the train car is everything that you can see around you in the universe \u2014 your house, your pet hedgehog Jeremy, the most distant stars in the sky, all of it. And the \u201cnext station\u201d is tomorrow.\n\n&gt;Just sitting there, it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re moving. It feels like you\u2019re sitting still. But if you sit there and do nothing, you will inevitably arrive at tomorrow.\n\n&gt;That\u2019s what it means to be in motion in the futureward direction. You, and everything around you, is currently moving in the futureward direction, toward tomorrow. You can\u2019t feel it, but if you just sit and wait for a bit, you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s true.\n\n&gt;So far, I think this has all been pretty easy to visualize. A little challenging maybe; it might not be intuitive to think of time as a direction and yourself as moving through it. But I don\u2019t think any of this has been too difficult so far.\n\n&gt;Well, that\u2019s about to change. Because I\u2019m going to have to ask you to exercise your imagination a bit from this point on.\n\n&gt;Imagine you\u2019re driving in your car when something terrible happens: the brakes fail. By a bizarre coincidence, at the exact same moment your throttle and gearshift lever both get stuck. You can neither speed up nor slow down. The only thing that works is the steering wheel. You can turn, changing your direction, but you can\u2019t change your speed at all.\n\n&gt;Of course, the first thing you do is turn toward the softest thing you can see in an effort to stop the car. But let\u2019s ignore that right now. Let\u2019s just focus on the peculiar characteristics of your malfunctioning car. You can change your direction, but you cannot change your speed.\n\n&gt;That\u2019s how it is to move through our universe. You\u2019ve got a steering wheel, but no throttle. When you sit there at apparent rest, you\u2019re really careening toward the future at top speed. But when you get up to put the kettle on, you change your direction of motion through spacetime, but not your speed of motion through spacetime. So as you move through space a bit more quickly, you find yourself moving through time a bit more slowly.\n\n&gt;You can visualize this by imagining a pair of axes drawn on a sheet of paper. The axis that runs up and down is the time axis, and the upward direction points toward the future. The horizontal axis represents space. We\u2019re only considering one dimension of space, because a piece of paper only has two dimensions total and we\u2019re all out, but just bear in mind that the basic idea applies to all three dimensions of space.\n\n&gt;Draw an arrow starting at the origin, where the axes cross, pointing upward along the vertical axis. It doesn\u2019t matter how long the arrow is; just know that it can be only one length. This arrow, which right now points toward the future, represents a quantity physicists call four-velocity. It\u2019s your velocity through spacetime. Right now, it shows you not moving in space at all, so it\u2019s pointing straight in the futureward direction.\n\n&gt;If you want to move through space \u2014 say, to the right along the horizontal axis \u2014 you need to change your four-velocity to include some horizontal component. That is, you need to rotate the arrow. But as you do, notice that the arrow now points less in the futureward direction \u2014 upward along the vertical axis \u2014 than it did before. You\u2019re now moving through space, as evidenced by the fact that your four-velocity now has a space component, but you have to give up some of your motion toward the future, since the four-velocity arrow can only rotate and never stretch or shrink.\n\n&gt;This is the origin of the famous \u201ctime dilation\u201d effect everybody talks about when they discuss special relativity. If you\u2019re moving through space, then you\u2019re not moving through time as fast as you would be if you were sitting still. Your clock will tick slower than the clock of a person who isn\u2019t moving.\n\n&gt;This also explains why the phrase \u201cfaster than light\u201d has no meaning in our universe. See, what happens if you want to move through space as fast as possible? Well, obviously you rotate the arrow \u2014 your four-velocity \u2014 until it points straight along the horizontal axis. But wait. The arrow cannot stretch, remember. It can only rotate. So you\u2019ve increased your velocity through space as far as it can go. There\u2019s no way to go faster through space. There\u2019s no rotation you can apply to that arrow to make it point more in the horizontal direction. It\u2019s pointing as horizontally as it can. It isn\u2019t even really meaningful to think about something as being \u201cmore horizontal than horizontal.\u201d Viewed in this light, the whole idea seems rather silly. Either the arrow points straight to the right or it doesn\u2019t, and once it does, it can\u2019t be made to point any straighter. It\u2019s as straight as it can ever be.\n\n&gt;That\u2019s why nothing in our universe can go faster than light. Because the phrase \u201cfaster than light,\u201d in our universe, is exactly equivalent to the phrase \u201cstraighter than straight,\u201d or \u201cmore horizontal than horizontal.\u201d It doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n\n&gt;Now, there are some mysteries here. Why can four-velocity vectors only rotate, and never stretch or shrink? There is an answer to that question, and it has to do with the invariance of the speed of light. But I\u2019ve rambled on quite enough here, and so I think we\u2019ll save that for another time. For right now, if you just believe that four-velocities can never stretch or shrink because that\u2019s just the way it is, then you\u2019ll only be slightly less informed on the subject than the most brilliant physicists who\u2019ve ever lived.", "rating": 1, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "author_flair_css_class": null, "created": 1316720518.0, "author_flair_text": null, "downs": 75, "author": "shnuffy", "created_utc": 1316720518.0, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Super reddit science god RobotRollCall explains it very well <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fjwkh/why_exactly_can_nothing_go_faster_than_the_speed/c1gh4x7\" >here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>There are a lot of simple, intuitive explanations of this to be had out there \u2026 but I kind of hate them all. You might google around a bit and find discussion of something called \u201crelativistic mass,\u201d and how it requires more force to accelerate an object that\u2019s already moving at a high velocity, stuff like that. That\u2019s a venerable way of interpreting the mathematics of special relativity, but I find it unnecessarily misleading, and confusing to the student who\u2019s just dipping her first toe into the ocean of modern physics. It makes the universe sound like a much different, and much less wonderful, place than it really is, and for that I kind of resent it.</p>\n\n<p>When I talk about this subject, I do it in terms of the geometric interpretation that\u2019s consistent with general relativity. It\u2019s less straightforward, but it doesn\u2019t involve anything fundamentally more difficult than arrows on pieces of paper, and I think it offers a much better understanding of the universe we live in than hiding behind abstractions like \u201cforce\u201d and outright falsehoods like \u201crelativistic mass.\u201d Maybe it\u2019ll work for you, maybe it won\u2019t, but here it is in any case.</p>\n\n<p>First, let\u2019s talk about directions, just to get ourselves oriented. \u201cDownward\u201d is a direction. It\u2019s defined as the direction in which things fall when you drop them. \u201cUpward\u201d is also a direction; it\u2019s the opposite of downward. If you have a compass handy, we can define additional directions: northward, southward, eastward and westward. These directions are all defined in terms of something \u2014 something that we in the business would call an \u201corthonormal basis\u201d \u2014 but let\u2019s forget that right now. Let\u2019s pretend these six directions are absolute, because for what we\u2019re about to do, they might as well be.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m going to ask you now to imagine two more directions: futureward and pastward. You can\u2019t point in those directions, obviously, but it shouldn\u2019t be too hard for you to understand them intuitively. Futureward is the direction in which tomorrow lies; pastward is the direction in which yesterday lies.</p>\n\n<p>These eight directions together \u2014 upward, downward, northward, southward, eastward, westward, pastward, futureward \u2014 describe the fundamental geometry of the universe. Each pair of directions we can call a \u201cdimension,\u201d so the universe we live in is four-dimensional. Another term for this four-dimensional way of thinking about the universe is \u201cspacetime.\u201d I\u2019ll try to avoid using that word whenever necessary, but if I slip up, just remember that in this context \u201cspacetime\u201d basically means \u201cthe universe.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So that\u2019s the stage. Now let\u2019s consider the players.</p>\n\n<p>You, sitting there right now, are in motion. It doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re moving. It feels like you\u2019re at rest. But that\u2019s only because everything around you is also in motion. No, I\u2019m not talking about the fact that the Earth is spinning or that our sun is moving through the galaxy and dragging us along with it. Those things are true, but we\u2019re ignoring that kind of stuff right now. The motion I\u2019m referring to is motion in the futureward direction.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you\u2019re in a train car, and the shades are pulled over the windows. You can\u2019t see outside, and let\u2019s further imagine (just for sake of argument) that the rails are so flawless and the wheels so perfect that you can\u2019t feel it at all when the train is in motion. So just sitting there, you can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re moving or not. If you looked out the window you could tell \u2014 you\u2019d either see the landscape sitting still, or rolling past you. But with the shades drawn over the windows, that\u2019s not an option, so you really just can\u2019t tell whether or not you\u2019re in motion.</p>\n\n<p>But there is one way to know, conclusively, whether you\u2019re moving. That\u2019s just to sit there patiently and wait. If the train\u2019s sitting at the station, nothing will happen. But if it\u2019s moving, then sooner or later you\u2019re going to arrive at the next station.</p>\n\n<p>In this metaphor, the train car is everything that you can see around you in the universe \u2014 your house, your pet hedgehog Jeremy, the most distant stars in the sky, all of it. And the \u201cnext station\u201d is tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Just sitting there, it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re moving. It feels like you\u2019re sitting still. But if you sit there and do nothing, you will inevitably arrive at tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s what it means to be in motion in the futureward direction. You, and everything around you, is currently moving in the futureward direction, toward tomorrow. You can\u2019t feel it, but if you just sit and wait for a bit, you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s true.</p>\n\n<p>So far, I think this has all been pretty easy to visualize.
